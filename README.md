Tortoise, they are living in the Kubernetes cluster. 

Tortoise, you need to feed only very few parameters to them.

Tortoise, they will soon start to eat historical usage data of Pods.

Tortoise, once you start to live with them, you no longer need to configure autoscaling by yourself.

## Install

Tortoise, you don't need a rearing cage, but need VPA in your Kubernetes cluster before installing it.
